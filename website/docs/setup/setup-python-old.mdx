This article is a guide on setting up Python on your personal workstation and how to manage multiple Python versions, virtual environments, and project dependencies.

- **Package Manager**: [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
- **Language Server**: [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance)
- **Static Type Checker**: [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright)

- **Code Formatter**: [Black](https://pypi.org/project/black/)

## Installing Python

The Python Version Manager, `pyenv` is my recommended method for installing Python. On macOS and Linux, the recommended tool is [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). On Windows, my recommended tool is [pyenv for Windows](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win).

```powershell
# Display the available Python 3.14 versions
pyenv install -l | findstr 3.14

# Install the latest Python 3.14 version
pyenv install 3.14
pyenv global
```

### pyenv for Windows

pyenv for Windows is a port of [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for Windows.

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win/master/pyenv-win/install-pyenv-win.ps1" -OutFile "./install-pyenv-win.ps1"; &"./install-pyenv-win.ps1"
```

Additional installation instructions and documentation can be found at `https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win`.

### pyenv

> pyenv lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Python. It's simple, unobtrusive, and follows the UNIX tradition of single-purpose tools that do one thing well.
