# Work-Item Label Guidelines

Instead of writing new work-item and pull request labelling guidlines, I refer to GitLab's own [label project management guidelines](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/project-management-guidelines/labels/) and [label customer support operations guidelines](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/security/customer-support-operations/docs/gitlab/labels/).
