# Editors and IDEs

I encourage using the right tools for the job, and since software development involves a lot of writing, using the correct editor for is very important regardless of how technical your role is. Engineers and developers will have more specialized needs, but everyone involved needs to write Markdown, and the best text editors will make this much easier.

A good editor/IDE will have:

- syntax highlighting, showing structure as well as content
- plugins to enable customization (such as spell-checking)
- integration with git, enabling managing commits and branches from within the editor
- the ability to open very large files efficiently
- not require a persistent internet connection
- powerful and fast search facilities
- the ability to automatically navigate between code declarations and usages in a large codebase

Many editors are free to use, some require paid licenses to unlock all features. There are many, many good text editors.
