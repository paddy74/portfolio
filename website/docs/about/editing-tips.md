## Unlisted and Draft Content

Docusaurus supports the ability to hide or remove content from production builds. This is supported for all Docusaurus content plugins: [docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs), [blog](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog), and [pages](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-pages).

**Remove** content from production builds using the `draft: true` front matter; the content will only be available during development.

**Hide** content using the `unlisted: true` front matter, which will keep your pages available in production builds, while "hiding" them and making them impossible to discover without a direct link.
