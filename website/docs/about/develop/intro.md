# Handbook Development Guide

This section describes how to get started with developing, maintaining, and publishing this handbook's website.

This handbook is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/); the [official Docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs) applies.

## Key Development Principles

- Maintain 100% passing tests, at least 80% test coverage, formatting, and linting before opening a pull request.
- Update docstrings alongside code changes to keep the generated reference accurate.

## Getting Started

- **Package Manager**: [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/)
- **Linter**:
  - TypeScript: [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
  - CSS: [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/)
  - Markdown: [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/vscode-markdownlint/)
- **Code Formatter**:
  - [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
  - Markdown: [Markdown All in One](yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)
- **Pre-Commit Hooks**: [prek](https://prek.j178.dev/)

```bash
cd website
# Install pnpm with corepack and run pnpm install
npm run init
# shamefully-hoist to handle issues with docusaurus-lunr-search
pnpm install --shamefully-hoist

# Start a local instance
pnpm run start

# Type check, lint, format
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run lint
pnpm run format

# Install pre-commit hooks
prek install
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome -- where appropriate for correcting things like spelling errors, bugs, or suboptimal code/configurations. To get started:

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch.
2. Install development dependencies (see the [developer guide](#developer-guide)).
3. Add or update tests together with your change.
4. Run the full test, linting, and formatting suite locally.
5. Submit a pull request describing your changes and referencing any relevant issues.

For major changes, open an issue first to discuss your proposal.
