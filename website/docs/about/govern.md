# About the Handbook

## Handbook Interpretation

A handbook is subject to interpretation; it is _opinionated_ and should not be considered an authoritative source. I do my best to be as clear as possible to minimize confusion and/or misinterpretation. I try to cite all source materials, so that readers can understand where information comes from and/or how a conclusion was reached. I also recognize that readers may bring many different interpretations. If you have any questions or need further clarification please check with the content owner of the page. When in doubt please reach out and ask.

Remember that [everything is in draft](../values.md#everything-is-in-draft) and subject to change, including this handbook.

## Documentation Strategy

This handbook's documentation strategy follows a [handbook-first](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation/) approach with guiding principles for open contribution and documentation as a single source of truth.

1. Provide a single source of truth for all technical documentation and guides.
2. Create documentation that is trusted; something that can be depended on.
3. Define [documentation governance](#handbook-governance) and processes for creating, updating, and managing documentation.
4. Follow the same change management workflows used for source code.
5. Be understandable, concise, current, accurate, and free of redundancy.
6. Provide strong version control; record the history and commentary around changes.

## Handbook Governance

The **Documentation Steward** will act as the product manager for this handbook and shall be the responsible authority for maintaining the organization and quality of this handbook. They are responsible for upholding the [Documentation Strategy](#documentation-strategy), adherence to [the Handbook Style Guide](./style-guide.md), and overseeing governance and delegation of documentation ownership and management.

A **Content Owner** is a role which delegates _some_ of the Documentation Steward's authority and responsibility for a specified section of this handbook. A Content Owner can in-turn delegate to additional content owners, but will remain the responsible authority for their section just as the Documentation Steward is the responsible authority for all sections. Content owners are generally assigned based on organization structure, product ownership, or according to a management or leadership role.

A change request must be approved by at least one content owner of the affected content.

### Controlled Documentation

Formal policies, standards, and procedures are controlled documents. This differs from uncontrolled documents: informal guides, certain pages or sections, blog posts, templates, etc.

For more information, see the [Controlled Document Procedure](./controlled-docs.md) page.

All readers are welcome and encouraged to submit a change request or issue to create or suggest changes to controlled documents at any time.
